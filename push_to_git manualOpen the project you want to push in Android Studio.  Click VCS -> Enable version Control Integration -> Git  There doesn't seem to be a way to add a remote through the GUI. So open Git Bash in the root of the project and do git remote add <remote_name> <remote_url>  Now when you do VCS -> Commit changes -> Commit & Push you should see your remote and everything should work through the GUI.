Open the project you want to push in Android Studio.

Click VCS -> Enable version Control Integration -> Git

There doesn't seem to be a way to add a remote through the GUI. So open Git Bash( terminal in andorid studio)in the root of the project and do git remote add <remote_name> <remote_url>

Now when you do VCS -> Commit changes -> Commit & Push you should see your remote and everything should work through the GUI.
